Optimizations

Started with 400px x 400px pictures, made smaller (250px x 250px) using Photoshop, the optimized using optimizilla.com . Because I used the images as backgrounds for my divs I could not get Sprites to work for me.

Changed <Title> to Dog Grooming|@CSPCA|GROOMED

Then added the meta "Description" tag of over 150 characters to index page.

Setup caching on website using .htaccess

added a sitemap.xml and added robots.txt to direct google to it.

Enabled gzip compression
